New TikTok users sign up with their emails, 
so each signup requires a text confirmation to activate the new user's account.

TWO TABLES:
emails A && texts B
A.email_id = B.email_id

QUESTION:
 query to find the confirmation rate of users who 
 confirmed their signups with text messages. 
 Round the result to 2 decimal places.

PSEUDO CODE:
1. LEFT JOIN both tables

SOLUTION 1:

WITH CTE AS

(
SELECT 
ROUND(COUNT(*)*1.0/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emails),2) AS confirm_rate
FROM emails A
LEFT JOIN texts B
ON A.email_id = B.email_id
WHERE B.signup_action = 'Confirmed'
)

SELECT * from cte

*/

SELECT
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN B.signup_action = 'Confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*1.0/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id),2) AS confirm_rate

FROM emails A
LEFT JOIN texts B
ON A.email_id = B.email_id
