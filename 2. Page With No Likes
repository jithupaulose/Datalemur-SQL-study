/**

Two Tables : pages and page likes
pages -->> Contain PageID and Name
PageLikes --->> contain UserID, PageID, LikedDate

JOIN BY PageID

PROBLEM: query to return the page IDs
of all the Facebook pages that don't have any likes.

PSEUDO Code:

LEFT JOIN the pages to PageLikes
WHERE page_likes.page_id is NULL

*/

SELECT
pg.page_id
FROM pages pg
LEFT JOIN page_likes pgLk
ON pg.page_id = pgLk.page_id
WHERE pgLk.page_id IS NULL;
