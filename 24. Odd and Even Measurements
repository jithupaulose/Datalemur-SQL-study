/** 
CONTEXT:
Table contains measurement values obtained from a sensor over several days. 
Measurements are taken several times within a given day.

QUESTION:
obtain the sum of the odd-numbered 
and even-numbered measurements on a particular day, 
in two different columns.

Clue: 1st, 3rd, 5th measurements within a day are considered odd-numbered 
measurements and the 2nd, 4th, 6th measurements are even-numbered measurements.

PSUEDO CODE:
1. CTE statement and a Window func - Row_number() 
2. Bolded comment says within a day - means partition by the each day
3. Take the date from the time:
    DATE(measurement_time)
    date_trunc('day',measurement_time )
    CAST(datetime_expression AS DATE)
    measurement_time::date
    
4. CASE/IF Statement SUM() rowNo%2 = 0 THEN

*/

WITH CTE AS 
(
SELECT
   *,
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY date_trunc('day',measurement_time ) 
   ORDER BY measurement_time ASC) AS rn   
   FROM measurements
)
SELECT 
date_trunc('day',measurement_time) measurement_day,
SUM(CASE WHEN rn%2 <> 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
SUM(CASE WHEN rn%2 = 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
FROM CTE
GROUP BY 1
order by 1;
