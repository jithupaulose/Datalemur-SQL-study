/**
CONTEXT:
Three Spotify tables containing information about the 
artists, songs, and music charts.

Tables:: artists A && songs B && global_song_rank C
JOIN condition:: 
  A.artist_id = B.artist_id
  B.song_id = C.song_id


PROBLEM: 
query to determine the top 5 artists 
whose songs appear in the 
Top 10 of the global_song_rank table the highest number of times

5 artist names in ascending order along with their song appearances ranking 


PSEDO CODE:
HIGHEST No of Times in the global_song_rank table  -->
means find count(distinct times)
find the top 5 artist name  : either limit 5

1. WITH CTE STATEMENT
2. ALL 3 TABLES JOIN TOGETHER
4. CALL OUT -- GROUP BY artist_name

*/
WITH CTE AS
(
  SELECT 
    artist_name,
    C.song_id as C_song_id,
    C.rank as C_rank
  FROM artists A
  JOIN songs B 
    ON A.artist_id = B.artist_id
  JOIN global_song_rank C
    ON B.song_id = C.song_id 
),
CTE2 AS
(
  SELECT 
    artist_name,
    COUNT(C_song_id),
    DENSE_RANK() OVER( ORDER BY COUNT(C_song_id) DESC) AS artist_rank
  FROM CTE
  WHERE C_rank <=10
  GROUP BY artist_name

SELECT 
  artist_name,
  artist_rank
FROM CTE2
WHERE artist_rank <= 5 ;
