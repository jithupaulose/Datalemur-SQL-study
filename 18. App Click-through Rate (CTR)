CONTEXT: events table on app analytics

PROBLEM: 
get the app’s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022.
results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places
To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0

Percentage of click-through rate = 
100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions

PSUEDO CODE:

Ç
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE O END) AS no_clicks
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE O END) AS no_impression
WITH CTE 
EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp) = 2022

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
  app_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_clicks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_impression
  FROM events
  --WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp) = 2022
  WHERE DATE_PART('year', timestamp) = 2022
  GROUP BY app_id
)

SELECT app_id,
  ROUND(no_clicks*100.0/no_impression,2) AS ctr
FROM CTE
