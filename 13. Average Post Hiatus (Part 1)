/**
COTEXT:
table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021


PROBLEM:
find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year 
and last post of the year in the year 2021

PSUEDO CODE:
1. FIND THE MIN(post_date) AND MAX(post_date) --> GROUP BY user_id IN 2021

Many ways can come up with this.
a. EXTRACT(DAYS FROM MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date))
b. DATE_PART('day', MAX(post_date::timestamp) - MIN(post_date::timestamp))
c. DATE_PART('day',max(post_date)-min(post_date) 
d. MAX(post_date::DATE)  - MIN(post_date::DATE)

FILTER year 2021
a. DATE_PART('year',post_date) = 2021
b. EXTRACT(year from post_date) = 2021

2. GET THE USER which commit atleast 2 posts
HAVING COUNT(user_id) > 1

*/
SELECT
user_id,
DATE_PART( 'day', MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE EXTRACT(year from post_date) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
