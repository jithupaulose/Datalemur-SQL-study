with the drugs that were not profitable 
and how much money CVS lost on these drugs.

2. drug_count = count(drug)
3. total_loss = abs(SUM(total_sales - cogs))
*/

SELECT
manufacturer,
count(drug) AS drug_count,
ABS(SUM(total_sales - cogs)) AS total_loss
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE total_sales - cogs <= 0
GROUP BY manufacturer
ORDER BY 3 DESC
