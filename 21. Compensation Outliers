/**
CONTEXT: review employees who are potentially overpaid or underpaid

PROBLEM:
query that shows the following data for each compensation outlier: 
employee ID, salary, and whether they are potentially overpaid or 
potentially underpaid 

An employee is considered to be potentially 
overpaid if they earn more than 2 times the average salary for people 
with the same title. 
Similarly, an employee might be underpaid if they earn 
less than half of the average for their title

PSEODO CODE:
1. Find the average salary for people with the same title
2. GROUP BY title
3. AVG(salary)
4. WITH CTE STATEMENT
5. CASE WHEN AVG(salary)* 2 < salary THEN Overpaid
6. WHEN AVG(salary)/ 2 > salary THEN Underpaid ELSE 'Paid ok'

WITH avg_CTE AS
(
SELECT 
  title,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employee_pay
GROUP BY title
),
status_CTE AS
(
SELECT
  E.*,
   CASE WHEN salary > avg_salary*2 THEN 'Overpaid'
        WHEN  salary < avg_salary/2 THEN 'Underpaid'
        ELSE 'Good' END AS status
FROM employee_pay E
LEFT JOIN avg_CTE A
ON E.title = A.title
)
SELECT 
  employee_id,
  salary,
  status
FROM status_CTE
WHERE status <> 'Good';
