/**
three tables: customers, datacenters, and forecasted_demand.

PROBLEM: 
understand how much data its customers are using, 
and how much spare capacity is left in each of it's data centers


find the total monthly unused server capacity for each data center. 
Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.


PSUEDO CODE:

1. FIND monthly_capacity - monthly_demand = spare_capacity
2. WITH CTE FIND THE SUM(monthly_demand) for each datacenter
3. JOIN with datacenters table and substract the monthly_capacity - sum_monthly_demand
*/

WITH sum_Demand_Monthly AS
(
SELECT 
  datacenter_id,
  SUM(monthly_demand) as sum_monthly_demand
FROM forecasted_demand
GROUP BY datacenter_id
)

SELECT 
  S.datacenter_id,
  (monthly_capacity - sum_monthly_demand) AS spare_capacity
FROM sum_Demand_Monthly S
JOIN datacenters D
ON S.datacenter_id = D.datacenter_id
order by 1
