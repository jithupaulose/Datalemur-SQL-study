/**
CONTEXT: payment transactions

transactions Table

QUESTION: 
yment transactions are repeated by accident; it could be due to user error,
API failure or a retry error that causes a credit card to be charged twice.

Using the transactions table, 
identify any payments made at the 
      same merchant with the 
      same credit card for the s
      ame amount 
      within 10 minutes of each other.
      
STEPS:
1. WITH CTE 
2. LAG(transaction_timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id,credit_card_id,
    amount ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
3. EXTRACT(minutes FROM )
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
  *,
  transaction_timestamp - LAG(transaction_timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id,credit_card_id,
    amount ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS timestampInterval
FROM transactions
)

SELECT COUNT(merchant_id) AS payment_count
FROM CTE WHERE EXTRACT(minutes FROM timestampInterval) < 10
