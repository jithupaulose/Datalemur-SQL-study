/**
CONTEXT:
 Tables below containing information on 
   Snapchat users, 
   their ages, 
   their time spent sending and opening snaps

TABLES:
  activities 
  age_breakdown
JOIN via user_id

PROBLEM:
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the 
time spent sending vs. opening snaps 
(as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) 
for each age group

Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

send_perc = time sending / (time sending + time opening)
open_perc = time opening / (time sending + time opening)

PSEDO CODE:
1. WITH CTE STATEMENT
2. CASE STATEMENT SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent) 
3. Similar to opening
4. GROUP BY user_id
5. INNER JOIN CTE with age_breakdown table on user_id
6.ROUND(,2)
7. Do the aggrgation here AND GROUP BY age_bucket

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
  SELECT
  user_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_time,
  SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_time
  FROM activities
  GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
A.age_bucket,
ROUND(SUM(send_time*100.0/(open_time + send_time)),2) AS send_perc,
ROUND(SUM(open_time*100.0/(open_time + send_time)),2) AS open_perc

FROM age_breakdown A
JOIN CTE C
ON A.user_id = C.user_id
GROUP BY age_bucket
